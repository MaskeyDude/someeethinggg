## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Snapshots

## What I learned?

My speed is going up. Okay, so seriously image overlay hover type effect whatever it's called I learned that :/

```css
 .Hero_Img {
    width: 100%;
    position: relative;
}
```

## Useful resources

[Navbar hover dropdown](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/show-hide-dropdown-menu-on-mouse-hover-using-css.php) - It's was annoying and cluttered 

[position: relative;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files) - I finally know how to access file outside of the folder

## Thoughts

I completed it in like 5 hours? as from previous project I got quite the hang of it. I don't know what I'm saying but yeah it caught my eye cuz of it's dark themed colors. Right now I'm kinda stuck at image hover thingy as it's a little taller than the image.
